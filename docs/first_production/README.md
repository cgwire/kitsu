# Create your First Production

## New Project - Create a Production

The first step in Kitsu is to create a production. Click on the **Create a new
production** button.

![Create a production](../img/getting-started/create_production.png)

Enter your production name, and choose **TV Show** if you need more than one episode.

Then, you have to fill in technical information, such as the number of FPS, the Ration, and the Resolution.

[!IMPORTANT]
All these data will be used when Kitsu re-encodes the video previews uploaded.


Then, you need to define your production's start and end dates.

![Add a production](../img/getting-started/add_production.png)

In the next part, 3 to 6, you can define your production pipeline.
First, you need to select your asset task type, shot task type, task status, and asset types.

![Add a production Pipeline](../img/getting-started/add_production_pipe.png)

Then, 7 and 8 are the option parts. If you already have a spreadsheet with your asset/shot.

See the **import CSV** section for more details.

[Import asset](../batch-action/README.md#create-assets-from-a-csv-spreadsheet-file)

[Import shot](../batch-action/README.md#create-shots-from-a-csv-spreadsheet-file)

Validate everything with the ![All done](../img/getting-started/all_done_go.png) button.

If you don't find all the **Task Types**, **Status**, or **Asset Types** you need while
creating the production. You will be able to add them to your production later.

See the **Customization** section for more details.

[Pipeline Customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md#task-type)


## Create Assets

So, now you have the first script for your production. Next, it's time to break down and create the assets. Finally, it allows you to list your assets,
dispatch the work to the artists, and follow each related
task's progress.

Let's begin with the asset page. You can access it via the dropdown menu at the top of the page.

![Drop down menu asset](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu.png)

On the asset page, click on **Add assets**.

![Asset page first time](../img/getting-started/add_assets_first.png)

A pop-up window opens:

It asks you to choose the asset **Type** (1): Camera, Characters, Environment,
FX, Props, ...
Let's start with a character.

Then, you select the **Main Pack**, or the **episode** (2)

We give it a **Name** (3) and enter a description that helps the Artist know what to do and quickly identify the asset.

Click on **Confirm and stay** if you have multiple assets to create.


![Create an asset](../img/getting-started/add_asset_popup.png)

You can change the asset type and keep adding assets.

You can also customize the asset type list and their tasks pipeline.
[Customization of the workflow](../customization-pipeline/README.md#modify-an-existing-asset-types) )


The newly created asset appears in the background whenever you click on **Confirm and stay**.


After adding your last asset, click
on **Confirm**. It saves the asset and closes the window. If you don't have
more assets to add, click on **Close**, it cancels the window.

The assets are linked with the first episode **E01** (created per default by Kitsu) or with the **Main Pack**.

![Global asset page](../img/getting-started/asset_edit.png)

You will also see the tasks are created at the same time. By default, all the tasks of your library will be added, and if you have set your parameters, only the selected tasks will be added.

If you need to add more **Assets**, click the **Add assets** button.

You can edit assets by going to the asset page, hovering over the asset you want to modify, and then clicking on the **edit** button
![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png) (1) on the right side of
the line.

![Edit an asset](../img/getting-started/asset_edit01.png)

To extend the description on the main asset page, click on the first words (2), and a pop-up opens with the full description.

To delete an asset, see the FAQ : [How to delete an asset](../faq-deletion/README.md##how-to-delete-an-asset)





## Create Episodes, Sequences, and Shots

It's time to do the breakdown of the storyboard. Meaning you can create
the sequences and the shots of the episode and associate assets to them.

Nb: Episodes are only mandatory for **TV Show** Production.

You can also create tasks for episodes and shots. See the ADVANCE section.

You need to go to the **Shots** page: you can use the
dropdown menu and click on the **SHOTS**.

![Drop down menu shot](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_shot.png)

Click on the **Add shots** button to start with the shot creation.

![First add shots](../img/getting-started/new_shot.png)

A new pop-up opens for the creation of the assets.
You can now create the episodes, the sequences, and the shots.

Enter the first episode using your code name, e01, then click
the **add** button (1). Then, do the same for the sequence, for instance, sq01,
then **add** (2), and now the shots: sh001, then again **add** (3).
You can also define padding for your shots.

![Manage shots](../img/getting-started/manage_shot.png)

You can now see that new shots are listed, described by their episode, and
sequence.
You have created the first shot of the first sequence of the first episode.

Now, let's add more shots than just one! As you can see, the box already contains your name
code but incremented, so you have to continue to click on **add** to
create more shots.

![Add shots](../img/getting-started/add_shots.png)

You have to do the same with the sequences and episodes.

If a shot is misplaced on a sequence, you have to edit the shot you want
![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png), and change the
sequence.

![edit shot Change sequence](../img/getting-started/edit_shot.png)


![Change sequence](../img/getting-started/change_seq.png)

If at some point you need to delete a shot, click on the **trash can**
icon on the right of the line ![Delete button](../img/getting-started/delete_button.png).
If you need to import this shot back, click on the restore button
![Restore button](../img/getting-started/restore_button.png).

To delete a shot, see the FAQ : [How to delete a shot](../faq-deletion/README.md#how-to-delete-a-shot)

To delete a sequence, see the FAQ : [How to delete a Sequence](../faq-deletion/README.md#how-to-delete-a-sequence)


## Introduction to Kitsu global Page

Welcome to the global asset page of Kitsu.

Let's take a look around.

![Presentation of the global page](../img/getting-started/presentation_global.png)

On the top part (1), you have the global navigation, which is always visible throughout all the production pages.

With the main menu button ![Main menu button](../img/getting-started/main_button.png), you can go to your productions and your tasks (it's common to all permissions). And because you are an administrator, you can access extra options, like the global view of the schedule, timesheets of your whole studio, and workflow customization.

You can choose between production. The name of the actual production is displayed now, but thanks to the dropdown menu, you can navigate from production to production (if you have several).

The next dropdown menu is here to help you navigate through the different pages of the production.
You always start with the asset page, but you can switch to shots, sequence, statistics, team, and breakdown. This dropdown menu lets you change the production setting (including the workflow).

If you have defined your production as a **TV Show**, you will have an episode dropdown menu with the **All assets**, **Main pack**, and episode options.


You have the global search and news from Kitsu on the right of the top screen. You can see all the new features with an animated gif.

 ![New features](../img/getting-started/latest_update.png).


Then, the bell shows you your notification (assignation, comments, tag)![Notification](../img/getting-started/notification_icon_on.png), the last icon before your avatar is the documentation button.
![documentation button](../img/getting-started/documentation_button.png)


Then, use your avatar to open your menu (setting, documentation, etc.).

![Profile enlarged](../img/getting-started/profil_enlarge.png).



The second part of the screen is common to the asset and shot page. This part always sticks to the top of the page, even if you scroll down.

The first element on the left is the filter box. You can type anything you want for simple filtering, sequence, asset type, etc.

If you need more advanced filtering, please use the filter builder button.

![Filter Builder](../img/getting-started/filter_builder.png)

You can then save all the filters and use them as your pages.


On the right part of the screen, there are some buttons (from left to right) to hide or display the assignation, hide or display the extra column, enlarge or reduce the thumbnail,
![display and Hide option](../img/getting-started/display_hide_option.png)

batch import thumbnail ![batch import thumbnail](../img/getting-started/add_thumbnails.png), and finally import ![Import button](../img/getting-started/import.png) or export ![export button](../img/getting-started/export.png) data.


Below, you have the name of the column. the (+) next to **Name** ![Add metadata column](../img/getting-started/add_column_custom.png) is here to create a new metadata column. Then, you have the name of the task type column.

On the far right of the screen, next to the scroll bar, is the option to hide and display a text column
![Display/hide text column](../img/getting-started/visible_column_detail.png).

We have created a **Studio** and **test** metadata column in this example.


The last part (4), at the bottom of the screen, is the sum-up of your displayed page. It means the sum-up will update if you filter the page.

You can see the number of elements (assets or shots), the total number of estimated days, and the total number of already spent days.


## Add a New User

Each Artist required an account. Go to the dropdown menu ![Main
menu](../img/getting-started/main_button.png), and under the **Studio**
section, choose **PEOPLE** page.

![People Menu](../img/getting-started/main_menu_people.png)

Then, click on the **+ Add a new user** button.

![Add a new user](../img/getting-started/add_employee.png)

A creation window opens. You can enter the first (1) and last name (2), the email (which is **mandatory** to create the account) (3), and the phone number (4).

You can add the new user to a **Department** (or several) (5).
See [Department Documentation](../department/README.md)

Then you need to define the role of the user: ** Artist**, **Supervisor**, **Production Manager**,
**Studio Manager**, **Vendor** or **Client** (6).  If the Artist is working right now, keep
him active; otherwise, select no. Validate by clicking the **Confirm** button.

![Create a new user](../img/getting-started/create_employee.png)

See the [permissions](../permissions/README.md) section for more information.
Artists, supervisors, production managers, vendors, and clients only see their assigned productions.

All the people are now part of your studio. They are added to a specific
production when you add them to a team on a production. Otherwise, they
won't have access to anything.



## Add a User to the Team

You need to add someone to a production to assign him a task.

On the dropdown menu at the top of the page, select the **TEAM** page.

![Drop down menu team](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_team.png)

On the **Team** page, you can see all the assignations for a specific project.
Switch to the page's top if you want to check another project team.

![Team page](../img/getting-started/team_page.png)


## Assign Tasks to an Artist

We can now return to the **ASSETS** page via the dropdown menu.

![Drop down menu asset](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_asset.png).

Now it's time to do your first assignment!

Click on the status (1) you want to assign.

![Assigned a task](../img/getting-started/task_assigned.png)

The **comment panel** appears on the right of the screen with the action tools.

![Blue menu](../img/getting-started/blue_menu.png)

You can now do the assignment. Click on the text input to see
the list of available people. Click on a person's name to perform and select
him. Then click on the confirmation button to complete the assignation.

![Selected people](../img/getting-started/select_people.png)

You can assign tasks to the same person in one step (1). Once the blue menu is visible, press **ctrl** on your Keyboard and select
multiple tasks. You can even use the **shift** key to choose a range of tasks
(2). When you have chosen everything you need, apply with the **Confirm**
button.

![Assigned multiple people](../img/getting-started/assigned_multiple.png)


In the same way, once you have selected someone, you can click on
 **or unassign from selection** to remove this assignation.

When you finish all the assignations, quit this mode using the **Escape** key,
or the cross on the top right corner of the action box.

Now you can see the avatar of the Artist next to each status.

![Assigned people](../img/getting-started/assignation.png)

To unclutter the list, you can hide this information with the **Hide
assignations** button on the top of the spreadsheet ![Hide assignations](../img/getting-started/hide_assignation.png).

Once you assign someone, he is part of the production team. Depending
In his position (Artist, Supervisor, Vendor), he only sees the production where
he's assigned.

Now, everybody knows what to do and who is doing what!


## Select the status for the Artist board page

When you assign a task to an artist, they will see the task on their todo page when they log in.

But they can also choose to display their task as a board view. Each **Status** will be a column, and the assigned task is a card that can be move from status to status depending on the progress of the task.

To setup the board view, you need to go to the setting page of your production.

![Setting page](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_setting.png)

Then go to the **Task Status** tab. You see the list of the status used on your production.

It will be the same status used as column on the board page. You can drag and move the satus to change the order as they will appear on the board view.


![Setting page status order](../img/getting-started/setting_status_order.png)

The next step is with the **Board Status** page.

![Setting page status board](../img/getting-started/setting_status_board.png)

Here you can choose which status will be displayed on the **Board** page depending on the permission.

Once it's done you artist should have a page like this.

![Artist board page](../img/getting-started/artist_board_page.png)


## Add the Frameranges

At this stage of the production, the animatic should be done. This means you have
the length (**number of frames**, **frame range In**, and **frame range Out**) for each shot. You can
add this information to the spreadsheet. This way, you are sure that all
the frames are calculated and none are missing or over-computed.

You may also be able to add a camera as an asset!

You need to edit the shots to fill in the frame range information. Click on the
edit button ![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png) on the right
side of the shot line.

![edit shot Change sequence](../img/getting-started/edit_shot.png)

You can enter the shots **In** and **Out** on the new window. Then, save with the **Confirm** button.

![Shot edit page](../img/getting-started/shot_edit.png)

Now, the frame range appears on the general spreadsheet of the shot page.

![Shot edit page](../img/getting-started/shot_framerange_global.png)

Now that you have unlocked the **Frames**, **In**, and **Out** columns, you can fill them
directly from the global shot page.

Click on the case you want to fill in and add the data.

If you fill in the **Frame In** and the **Frame Out**, Kitsu will calculate the number
 of frames automatically.

![Shot edit page](../img/getting-started/shot_framerange_global_edit.png)


You can also use the **CSV Import** to update your frame range quickly.
 [Update Shots information with CSV Import](../batch-action/README.md#update-shots-information-with-csv-import)

You can have access to the shot values history, too.

![Shot framerange detail](../img/getting-started/shot_framerange_detail.png)

![Shot Values History](../img/getting-started/shot_values_history.png)


## Change Status and Add a Comment

To change the status of a task and write a comment, you need to click on the
status of the task.

![Shot status](../img/getting-started/shot_status.png)

It makes a panel appear on the right, and here, you can write a comment, change the status, and attach a file.

![Comment Panel](../img/getting-started/comment_panel.png)

The **Commen Panel** is split into 2 tabs : 
- POST COMMENT
- PUBLISH REVISION

To change the **Status**, stay in **POST COMMENT** tab.

The comment uses the **Markdown** language. If you need specific syntax, feel free to look at the markdown guide website: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/


On the **Leave a Comment...** section, you can **tag** someone on the team in the comments. Type the `@`and it opens a sub-menu with the list of the team.

![Tag someone](../img/getting-started/tag_team.png)

You can also **tag** a full department by typing '@' and the department's name.

![Tag department](../img/getting-started/tag_department.png)

You can add a **checklist** to your comments.

You need to click on the **Add checklist** button, and the first item of the checklist appears.

![add checklist](../img/getting-started/add_checklist.png)

Type your comments, hit the **Enter** key to add another line to your checklist, or click the **Add Checklist** button again.

![checklist](../img/getting-started/checklist_detailed.png)

Besides your comment, you can also attach a file as a picture. Click on the **Add attachment** button.

![Add Attachment Simple](../img/getting-started/attachment_snapshot.png)

Select a **file from your hard drive** or past a **screenshot** here.

![Attachment snapshot](../img/getting-started/add_attachmen_simplet.png)


Validate the attachment by clicking on **Add file as attachment**.


Then select the **Status** that you need on the dropdown menu. 

![Status List](../img/getting-started/status_list.png)

Then click the **Post** button to post it to the world.


## Publish a Preview as a Version

To publish a preview, picture, or video, select the **PUBLISH REVISION** tab on the comment panel of the task.

Kitsu will automatically switch to the **Publish Revision** tab when you use status with the option **IS FEEDBACK REQUEST**, like the **WFA** Status.

![Publish Revision](../img/getting-started/publish_revision.png)


You can add one or several previews to any comments. It can be a picture (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`), a video (`.mp4`, `.mov`, `.wmv`),
or an `.glb` file. You can review all the previews from the browser or mix everything.

For the `.glb` file you can also review it as wireframe, or add a `.HDR` file to check the lighting. 

See the **Customization** section for more details.
[Pipeline Customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)


Other files like `.pdf`, `.zip`, `.rar`, `.ma`, or `.mb`, however, need to be
downloaded to be reviewed.


Then, click on the **Add preview revision to publish** button. The explorer opens and lets you choose your file or several files.

![attach preview](../img/getting-started/attach_preview.png)

You can also **copy-paste a screenshot** to this screen.

You will see a preview of the attached files.

![attach preview filled](../img/getting-started/attach_preview_filled.png)


Once your file is selected, you will see its name near the **Attach preview** button.

![attach preview confirmed](../img/getting-started/attach_preview_confirm.png)

You can also **drag & drop** the file in the comment section.

![attach preview drag drop](../img/getting-started/drag_drop_preview.png)


On top of your preview, you can add a **Comment**.

Click the **Leave a Comment** button to unfold the comment section.

![Add a comment to a Publish](../img/getting-started/publish_revision_comment.png)


You can select your status and publish your preview with the **Post** Button.


## Publish a Concept

To publish a **Concept**, go to the **Concept** page with the navigation menu.

![Concept Menu](../img/getting-started/menu_concept.png)

To upload a concept, click the **Add a new reference to concepts** button.

You can upload one or several concepts at the same time.

![Concept empty page](../img/getting-started/concept_empty_prod.png)

Once you upload your previews, the concept page will look like this.

![Concept filled page](../img/getting-started/concept_filled_prod.png)


You can interact with the concept in two ways: click on the picture to see an enlarged view.
The second is to click on the status part to open the **Comment Panel** on the right.

You have two options on the comment panel: link a concept with an existing asset or delete the concept.
You can also comment and change the status of the asset.

The idea is to have one version per **Concept**. If it's not validated, you need to upload a new concept, not to have multiple versions of the same concept.

One concept is one task.


![Concept options](../img/getting-started/concept_options.png)


## Link a Concept to an Asset

Once concepts are uploaded, you can link them to the assets.

You can see the links on the status part of the assets.

Click on the status part of the concept; it will open the comment panel on the right.

![Concept Comment Panel](../img/getting-started/concept_comment_panel.png)

On the comment panel, you have two options on top of the panel: Link a concept to an asset and delete the concept.

To link an asset, click on the **Link** ![Link button](../img/getting-started/link_icon.png) button.

Kitsu will display all the **Assets** available to link with the concept uploaded.

On top of the comment panel, Kitsu will list the linked assets. For now, there are **No Links**.


![Concept link](../img/getting-started/concept_link.png)

To link an asset, you have to click on it. You will see the name of the assets linked on the top of the screen, but also under the preview of the concept.


![Concept asset linked](../img/getting-started/concept_asset_linked.png)

Once a concept is linked to an asset, you can see the concepts on the detail page of an asset.

Return to the asset page, and click on the asset name you want to see the concept.

![Detail asset page](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_page.png)

Per default, the casting detail is displayed on the second part of the screen. 
Use the dropdown menu to choose the concept.

![asset detail concept](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_concept.png)

Once in the concept section, you will see all the concepts created for this asset. You can filter them per status.

![asset detail concept list](../img/getting-started/asset_detail_concep_listt.png)




## Add a Thumbnail

To define a preview as a thumbnail, the preview MUST have been uploaded as a revision. 

To publish a preview, picture, or video, select the **PUBLISH REVISION** tab on the comment panel of the task.

You can use the preview as a **thumbnail** on the asset or shot task. It
helps to recognize the assets/shots on the main pages.
On the list page, click on the status you want, then on the right panel, click the **Preview** button (1).

![Thumbnail Button](../img/getting-started/pannel_history.png)

Once you have clicked on the button, you can choose if you want to pick the first or any frame; once the frame is selected, you see the thumbnail appear, and the button turns gray.

![thumbnail applied](../img/getting-started/pannel_history_thumbnail.png)


## Perform a Review

When an artist needs a **review**, he changes the status of his task, too ![wfa](../img/getting-started/wfa_icon.png).

Click on status to open the right panel and start the review.

You can watch the version from the right panel, enlarge it by grabbing the side of the panel, or even go fullscreen ![Fullscreen](../img/getting-started/fullscreen.png).

![review on global page](../img/getting-started/review_global.png)

For the 3D file (`.glb` file) you can also review it as wireframe, or add a `.HDR` file to check the lighting. 

You can move around the 3d file with a drag and move with your cursor, and zoom in or out with the scroll.

![review 3d wireframe](../img/getting-started/review_wireframe.png)

![Preview background example](../img/getting-started/preview_background_example.png)

See the **Customization** section for more details.
[Pipeline Customization](../customization-pipeline/README.md)

You can draw directly on the preview with the **Pencil** tool and select a color ![Pencil](../img/getting-started/draw.png).

![review drawing](../img/getting-started/review_comment.png)

You can also add **text** on the frame.

![review drawing text](../img/getting-started/review_comment_text.png)


If you need to see the preview without your comment, **hide your annotation**, you can click on the **Fountain Pen** button.
![Hide Annotation](../img/getting-started/hide_annotation.png)


You can tag a frame (whatever version you are in), type the `@`and it opens a sub-menu with the team list, and start typing **frame**.

![Tag a frame](../img/getting-started/tag_frame.png)


You can also export your drawings on each frame by attaching the **screenshots as attachments**.

Click on the **Add attachment** button.

![attachment](../img/getting-started/attachment_retake.png)

You can also choose to **Attach snapshots from your annotation** on the attachment option.

![Attachment snapshot](../img/getting-started/screenshot_attachment.png)

Once you click the button, Kitsu will grab all the frames with annotation and display the result. You can publish them with **Confirm**.

![Attachment snapshot detail](../img/getting-started/attachment_snapshot_detail.png)


If you need to delete your line, click the **pencil** icon again, and the cursor changes to a multi-directional cross ![Pencil](../img/getting-started/direction_arrow.png), and then you can select your line and move it around.

![review drawing](../img/getting-started/review_edit.png)

Select the line with the directional cross, then press the **delete** icon ![Delete line](../img/getting-started/delete_line.png)


If you go into **Full-Screen**, you can compare two task types or versions side by side when you click on the **Compare** button
![compare button](../img/getting-started/compare_button.png).

![compare button](../img/getting-started/compare_version.png)

From there, you can change the status too![Retake](../img/getting-started/retake_icon.png) if you want the Artist to perform some changes.


Alternatively, you can change it to ![Done](../img/getting-started/done_icon.png) to notify the Artist that his work is validated.


## Review a Concept

Once your artists upload the concept, you can review it with the supervisor or the director.

To review the concept, you use the navigation menu at the top of the screen and select the concept page.

![Menu concept](../img/getting-started/menu_concept.png)

You can see all the concepts uploaded, the status, assignation, and linked assets.

![Ccncept filled status](../img/getting-started/concept_empty_prod_linked.png)


To review a concept, click the status part to open the comment panel. You can enlarge the comment panel or go fullscreen.

Then, write a comment, select the status **Approved** or **Rejected**, and validate with the **Post** button.

![Ccncept status comment](../img/getting-started/concept_status_comment.png)

You can filter the page with the **Status** filter to display all the **Neutral** status concepts.

![Ccncept status filter](../img/getting-started/concept_status_filter.png)

You can also filter per artist and change the order sort.

## Create a Breakdown List

Filling out the breakdown helps you with the assembly of the shots. With the
breakdown, you have all the details of the assets you need to add to create your
shot, and we are sure to omit nothing.

On the dropdown menu, choose **BREAKDOWN**.

![drop down Menu breakdown](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_breakdown.png)

On the left of the breakdown page is the episode/sequence/shot menu (1); you can choose between those you created. They are the right part of
the screen; all the assets created are available for this production (main pack and episodes) (3). Moreover, in
the middle section, it is your selection for the shot (2).

![Breakdown page](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_empty.png)

So now you have to select the shot you want to cast.

You can display the assets as text if you don't have thumbnails yet or enlarge the
thumbnails size.


![Breakdown page text display](../img/getting-started/breakdown_text_display.png)

You may also realize an asset needs to be added to the list during your breakdown.

You can create a new asset directly from the breakdown page. Click the **+** on the right of the **All available assets**.

![Breakdown page create asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_create_asset.png)


You can also choose multiple shots at the same time. Click on the first shot, hold the **shift** key, and click on the last shot of your selection.

![Breakdown page global bulk select](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select.png)

Then click on the assets you want
to assign: characters, backgrounds, ... from the right part (3).
If you have selected multiple shots, your selection is applied to the numerous shots.

Copy a shot filled with assets and paste this asset selection into another shot.

You can see a **+1** or **+10** when you pass over the asset. It's the number
of times you add this asset, and you can click on it as many times as you need.

![Breakdown add asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_add_asset.png)

You can also link all your assets to episodes on a TV show without specifying a sequence or shot.

![Breakdown episode asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_episode.png)

This way, you can link all your assets to one or several episodes before the storyboard/animatic stage.

You can now see the asset in the middle of the screen (2). Next
to the asset's name is the number of times it has been added. In this
example, we have added the character asset Llama two times.


If you add an asset twice by mistake, you must go to the screen's middle part to select assets for this shot (2). From there, click on
**-1**. When you finish this shot, go on with the other shots.
Your selection is automatically saved.

![Breakdown remove asset](../img/getting-started/breakdown_remove_asset.png)

If a new asset is created during the storyboard, return to the asset
page (using the dropdown menu) and create the needed assets. The tasks previously created are applied immediately to these new
assets. However, you have to do the assignment, and then you can
continue with the breakdown.

Now, your **Breakdown** page should look like this.

![breakdown add asset bulk](../img/getting-started/breakdown_general_bulk_select_full.png)

You can also make a breakdown list for your assets if you need to assemble them and keep track of the separate parts.

On the top left corner of the screen, choose **asset** in the dropdown menu below **FOR**.

![Breakdown asset menu](../img/getting-started/breakdown_asset_menu.png)

You can now access a second dropdown menu to choose your asset type: **Character**, **Environment**, **Props**, **FX**, ...

![Breakdown asset type](../img/getting-started/breakdown_asset_menu_type.png)

You can fill the asset breakdown page the same way as the shots. First, select one or more assets on the left part and then add the right part's elements.

## Change Asset Status

For example, when an asset is validated at the **Concept** stage, it can be used for the storyboard.
Then, when it's validated at the **Modeling** stage, you can use it for the layout and so on.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status.png)

It's useful to know the global status of the state of life of an asset, especially when the breakdown is complete.

On the global page of the shot, you will see a green box: all the assets cast in this shot are ready for this specific task.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status_box.png)

If you don't see the green box, Kitsu will display how many assets are ready.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status_empty.png)

 Then, you can click on the shot's name to go to its detail page.
Then, you will see all the assets cast in this shot and their status.

![Asset Status](../img/getting-started/asset_status_detail.png)

It's the fastest way to know if you can start a shot for a specific task.


## Add an Estimation for a Task

Click on the name of a task type.

![Task type](../img/getting-started/supervisor_tasktype.png)

The new page is the **Supervisor view**. You have more detailed information specific to this specific **task type**.

![Supervisor page](../img/getting-started/supervisor_page.png)


To add an estimation to a task, click on the line and type the number of days you estimate. You can select multiple assets or shots at the same time.

You can also define a **Start date** by clicking on it.
A calendar will open and let you choose your start date.

The **Due date** is automatically calculated with the **Estimation**.

![start date](../img/getting-started/set_estimation.png)


To go further in detail with the Supervisor's view :
- (1) You can see and change the status of a task
- (2) You can assign people to tasks

(1) and (2) are filled with the action menu.

- (3) You can add an estimation for the task (in day unit)
- (4) Kitsu calculates the sum of the timesheet fed by the artists
- (5) The number of back-and-forths with the retake status
- (6) You can add a start date for the task (with the calendar)
- (7) Kitsu calculates the due date with the Start Date and the estimation
- (8)(9) the Wip and Feedback dates are automatically filled
- (10) The last comment section helps you keep an eye on the last activity of this task type.

(7) to (10) is automatically filled.


To help you set a correct estimation, you can use the **Estimation** Tab.

![Estimation tab](../img/getting-started/tasktype_estimation_tab.png)

The left part of the screen lists the shots with the assignation and the number of frames (1).
Depending on the **FPS** you have set for the production, the number of **Seconds** will be automatically calculated (2).



 On the right part of the screen, you can see the full team of the department (depending on the assignments you made), the number of shots they have to do, the number of frames and seconds, and the average Quota.
 You will also have the **Remaining** line, which gives you the actual situation of your team.


 And the last column is the **Estimation**. To modify the estimation, hover the line with your mouse and click the editing zone.

 You can also select multiple shots simultaneously to edit them all at once.

 ![Estimation tab edit](../img/getting-started/tasktype_estimation_tab_edit.png)

 Every time you change the **Estimation** (in the number of days) on the right part, you can see in real-time that the **Average Quota** is updated.



 For more information about the **Schedule** tab, go to the
 [Task Type Schedule](../schedules/README.md#Set-a-Task-Estimation)


## The Timesheets

As Studio Manager, you can use the main menu to check the timesheets.

Open the main menu with the ![main button](../img/getting-started/main_button.png) button.

On the menu, choose the **Timesheets** page.

![main button](../img/getting-started/timesheet_menu.png)

Per default, Kitsu will display the timesheet of all the production, but you can choose to see
the timesheet for a specific production only.

![main button](../img/getting-started/timesheet_day.png)

You can choose which **month** or **year** you want to display.

You can also choose the detail level: **day**, **week**, **month**.

Each week, Kitsu highlights the overdue time per ArtistArtist.

![main button](../img/getting-started/timesheet_week.png)

If you click on a number, a side panel opens with the details of the time spent per task this week.

You can also set up several working hours per day.

Go back to the main menu and select **Settings**.

![Setting](../img/getting-started/setting.png)
