Now, you are into your production on the asset page.

![Main page production](../img/getting-started/first_production.png)

You need to click on the avatar of the production to access its different pages.

The first step you need to do is to set the **settings** of your production.

Use the navigation menu and go to the **Settings** page.

![Production settings](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_setting.png)

### Add a Brief

On the first tab of the **Settings** page, Kitsu asks you about a brief. It's a good way to keep track of the first 
brief of the production and being able to get back to it later.

/!\ **Only Studio manager permission have access to the Settings page** /!\
