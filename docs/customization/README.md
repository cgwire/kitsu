for an Active Production, or Closed if not Active). When your cursor is above a
production line, you can see two news icons on the right part of the line :
**edit** ![Edit button](../img/getting-started/edit_button.png) and **delete**
![Delete button](../img/getting-started/delete_button.png).

To modify a production, go into the **Edit production** page. 

You can add some specific information as the **FPS** (Frames per second), 
the **Ratio** and the **Resolution** of the picture.

If nothing is filled, the **FPS** is set to **24 FPS** per default. 
The **FPS** will be applied to re-encode the video and also to calculate the quotas.

NB: The default avatar for a production is the first letter displayed on a
colored background. You can change it with a picture if you want.
