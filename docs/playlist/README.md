# Playlist

## Create a playlist


You can find the **Playlists** page on the drop-down menu. 

![Playlist main menu](../img/getting-started/drop_down_menu_playlist.png)

The **playlist** page is separated into two parts: 

- (1) The playlist list where you can **create** a playlist or load an existing one.
- (2) The last created playlists and the last modified playlists

![Playlist page](../img/getting-started/playlist_page.png)

Start by creating a **Playlist** 
![Playlist add button](../img/getting-started/playlist_add_button.png). Your default name
is the date and the hour. You can change it immediately. You can choose if the playlist
will be shared with the **studio** or the **client** and if it's a **shot** or **asset** playlist.
You can also add a **Task Type** tag to the playlist.

![Playlist add page](../img/getting-started/playlist_add_page.png)

Once the playlist created, via the search/filter bar, you can select which shots to add
to your playlist. 

You can also choose to **add whole movie**, and it will add all the shots of the movie.

You can select **Daily pending**, which will add all the **WFA** tasks of the day.

Otherwise, you can **Add the whole sequence** if you want to focus only on a particular sequence.

You can use the same **filter** than on the global shot/asset page. For example, you can select all the 
WFA short for the animation stage.
You have to type **animation=wfa** in the search bar. Valid your selection with the **Add selection** button. 
Kitsu will select the shots that have the **WFA** status at the **Animation** stage, but Kitsu will automatically load **the latest uploaded version**.

The shots appear on the top part of the screen. Every change are 
automatically saved.
