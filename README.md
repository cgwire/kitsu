## About authors

Kitsu is written by CG Wire, a company based in France. We help small to
midsize CG studios to manage their production and build pipeline efficiently.

We apply software craftmanship principles as much as possible. We love coding
and consider that strong quality and good developer experience matter a lot.
Our extensive experience allows studios to get better at doing software and
focus more on the artistic work.
